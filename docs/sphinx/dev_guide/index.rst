RAJA Performance Suite Developer Guide
########################################

RAJA Performance Suite development follows nearly identical processes as
RAJA development, which are documented in the 
`RAJA Developer Guide <https://raja.readthedocs.io/en/develop/sphinx/dev_guide/index.html>`_ 

This guide is structured the same as the RRAJA Developer Guide and refers to 
sections in that on development topics. It also contains information about 
differences in development and maintenance specific to the RAJA Performance 
Suite.
