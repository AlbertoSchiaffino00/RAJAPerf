********************************************
Contributing to the RAJA Performance Suite
********************************************

The most important things to know about making a contribution to the 
RAJA Performance Suite involve the organization of the source code and
how it works, especially when adding a new Kernel or Variant. These items
are described in detail in :ref:`structure-label`.

At a more basic level, the RAJA Performance Suite is a collaborative 
open-source software project, similar to RAJA, and we encourage contributions 
from anyone who wants to add features or improve its capabilities. This 
section describes the following:

  * GitHub project access
  * How to develop a RAJA *pull request* (PR) contribution.
  * Requirements that must be met for a PR to be merged.

We assume contributors are familiar with 
`Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_, which we use for source code version control,
and `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_, which is where our project is hosted. 

.. important:: * Before a PR can be merged into the RAJA Performance Suite, 
                 all test checks must pass and the PR must be approved by at 
                 least one member of the core RAJA team.

Access to the RAJA Performance Suite GitHub project and acceptance of 
contributions to it are managed identically to the RAJA project. In the 
RAJA Developer Guide, you will find information on accessing the RAJA GitHub 
project, restrictions on a fork of the repository, contributions and pull 
requests. Please follow the RAJA processes for contributions to the 
RAJA Performance Suite.

Please see `Contributing to RAJA <https://raja.readthedocs.io/en/develop/sphinx/dev_guide/contributing.html>`_ for more information.
